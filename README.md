Hoss
====

A word processor in Haskell.

Instructions to build:

First go to the Displayable directory and do cabal install. Then go to the inner Hoss directory and do cabal install. Finally, move the executable into the root of Hoss so it can access the toolbar images.

Problems to solve with this project:
<ul>
<li>Get printing working
<li>Support linking to arbitrary objects instead of just bitmaps
<li>Make it stop crashing when you go to open or save.
</ul>

Looking for Haskellites to hack on this project.
